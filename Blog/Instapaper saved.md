For the record, after a downtime of over two months, [*Instapaper*](https://instapaper.com) finally became accessible to European users again[^1]. Just when everyone was (rightfully) giving up hope for a happy ending, word came out that Pinterest is transferring ownership of the app to the developers who worked on the app during the [Betaworks](https://betaworks.com) years.

In order to refinance work invested into the app by the new owners, *Instapaper Premium* makes its return in exchange for the same amount of money that the service charged before the acquisition by Pinterest.

Although I’m still a bit grumpy about the extended downtime I think I will become an Instapaper user again. Regrettably, the app hasn’t got much attention during the Pinterest years. I’d love to be convinced of the prospect of a brighter future by the advent of new features going forward.
