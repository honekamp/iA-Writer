What can I say, I did not see this coming. [*Newton* is back on the App Store][nb]. The news broke to me after reading a [sceptical tweet][ismh1] written by [Stephen Hacket][ismh] that linked to an article in [9to5Mac][9to5].

Would I be willing to switch back to *Newton*? Instead of a straight answer, let me give a short recap of my client usage since *Newton*’s regrettable shut-down. 

I’ve spent the *Newton*-less time period mostly using [*Edison Mail*][edison]. *Edison* is a solid alternative, but no actual replacement. And it has it’s own problems. For example, the rendering of folder trees in my main account is seriously broken.

Over time, I also switched to using *Outlook*, Apple’s own *Mail.app*, and - in times of desperation - even [*Airmail*][am] and [*Spark*][spark].

*Airmail* didn’t last longer than a a day, it’s still as buggy as it ever was. *Spark* made a mess out of a message I’ve got for confirmation of a Genius Bar appointment. 

Seriously, this specific message rendered in *Spark* does not even look similar to what it looks like in any other client. It was not even possible to distill a calendar entry from what Spark presented me with. Who believes that such a behavior is a good idea?

On the bright side, my impression of *Mail.app* was surprisingly positive. But it finally wasn’t able to muster enough gravity to keep me in orbit. Lack of sharing options, rendering of messages, no way to print a message[^1], just to name a few shortcomings.

One of the biggest upsides of *Edison* (and *Newton*, for that matter) is that it uses the space that it gets and renders e-mails such that they become actually readable. 

I’ve got two exhibits as counter-examples: *Mail.app* and *Outlook*. Especially the latter is the worst in this regard. On iPad, *Outlook* inexplicably uses only a small fraction of the available space to render messages, and the result in many cases is way too small to be comfortably read.  

All that said, will I be spending money for *Newton*? Well, probably. I’ve got a couple of weeks on my existing plan[^3] before I need to decide about renewing my subscription. If the subscription rate were half the price it would be a no-brainer for me. But the current price makes me think twice.

On the other hand, with respect to my personal set of requirements against an iOS e-mail client, *Newton* does a near perfect job[^2], and (again, in my personal impression) **none** of the competitors comes close.

[^1]: Yes, in very limited cases I actually print e-mails. This happens mostly to get compensation for business trips using public transport.
[^2]: The new version of *Newton* comes with nice additions to the already impressive feature set.
[^3]: For which I got a partial refund after *Newton* was officially taken down.
